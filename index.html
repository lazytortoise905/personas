                The interface I have selected is the <strong>Coca Cola vending machine</strong> in the back of the Sharpe Refectory at Brown University.
                I prepared some questions that I could use to interview random users (with their consent):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Do you <strong>like</strong> this interface?</li>
                <li>Would you <strong>change, add, or remove</strong> anything from this interface? You can say no if you cannot think of anything. </li>
                <li>What do you, if anything, if there is a <strong>line</strong> at the machine?</li>
                <li>Do you always get the <strong>same drink</strong>?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This machine is able to efficiently provide students with access to many types of soft drinks without taking up
                a ridiculous amount of space. As a result, it provides dining halls an easy way to give students many options
                without allocating a ton of space or money to many types of machines. It works by mxing the syrups for
                a wide variety of drinks with the same standard soda or water base. There is a <strong>screen</strong> which provides
                a touch interface for users to select their drinks or even filter the type of drinks displayed. There is also a
                <strong>lever</strong> which is triggered by pushing a cup into it which dispenses the selected drink. There is also another
                <strong>lever</strong> which is triggered in a similar fashion to dispense ice. Lastly, users are able to pour their drinks into
                the <strong>drain</strong> which keeps the immediate surrounding surface cleaner than if spills were just poured onto the countertop.

            <h2>Observation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  Some users will not use this machine if there is a line
                  <ul>
                    <li>I observed that some users would rather just go get a different drink - such as water or milk - then use this machine if there is a line</li>
                    <li>Some users do not seem to care if there is a line</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Users will not reset this machine to the home screen after filling up their cup</li>
                <li>Users may use the drain to empty their cups into</li>
                <li>Users do not use the filters</li>
                  <li>
                  Users tend to spam inputs if the screen is operating slowly
                  <ul>
                    <li>Continuously tapping the water button until it is "selected"</li>
                    <li>Some users will be more patient, others more impatient</li>

            <h2>Interview</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Do you like this interface?</strong>
                  <br></br>
                  The first student I talked to expressed mostly distaste for the interface: "It is annoying to navigate and can be really laggy," he said. 
                  The second student expressed her distaste with the availability of the drinks - denoted by greyed out circles on the screen: 
                  "Most of the drinks are usually not full," she said. The third student expressed that he did not really have any opinion on it.
                  <br></br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Would you change, add, or remove anything from this interface? You can say no if you cannot think of anything.</strong>
                  <br></br>
                  The first student noted that he would prefer a different organizational structure as the circles did not make much sense to him and the 
                  next two did not have any significant comments.
                  <br></br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>What do you, if anything, if there is a line at the machine?</strong>
                  <br></br>
                  Two of the students shared that they would revert to another alternative, such as the water or milk.
                  <br></br>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Do you always get the same drink?</strong>
                  <br></br>
                  Every student shared that they usually select between 1-2 sodas or water.
                  <br></br>

            <p>
                In this section, I am introducing two character archetypes that typify the type of users interacting with this interface. Since they both are
                dealing with the same interface, they both deal with the same problems:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Long lines to the machine</li>
                <li>Slow processor makes working with the machine difficult</li>
                <li>Lack of supply causes many of the drinks to be unavailable which is unclear from far away due to the inconspicuous marker for "unavailable"</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <h2>Patient Peter</h2>
            <p>
                Patient Peter is a complacent user - someone who waits in a line for an inefficient machine when others would not. This persona represents some of
                the users I interviewed who expressed a "this is fine" attitude towards this interface. The machine works, sometimes; but it works well enough to
                make users like patient peter accept the reality of the situation.

            <h2>Impatient Iman</h2>
            <p>
                Impatient Iman is a non-complacent user - someone who will simply find alternative options rather than waste her time waiting in line for a machine that,
                albeit does contain more options, is slow and annoying to use. This persona represents some of the users I interviewed who expressed that when
                there is a line they will simply go get milk or water.

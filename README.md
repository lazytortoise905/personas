## Part 1: Preparation

# Interface
The interface I have selected is the **Coca Cola vending machine** in the back of the Sharpe Refectory at Brown University.

I prepared some questions that I could use to interview random users (with their consent):
<ol>
  <li>Do you like this interface?</li>
  <li>Would you change, add, or remove anything from this interface? You can say no if you cannot think of anything. </li>
  <li>What do you, if anything, if there is a line at the machine?</li>
  <li>Do you always get the same drink?</li>
</ol>

<br></br>

### Description:
This machine is able to efficiently provide students with access to many types of soft drinks without taking up
a ridiculous amount of space. As a result, it provides dining halls an easy way to give students many options
without allocating a ton of space or money to many types of machines. It works by containing the syrups for
a wide variety of drinks, mixing them with the same standard soda or water base. There is a `screen` which provides
a touch interface for users to select their drinks or even filter the type of drinks displayed. There is also a
`lever` which is triggered by pushing a cup into it which dispenses the selected drink. Similarly, there is another
`lever` which is triggered in a similar fashion to dispense ice. Lastly, user are able to pour their drinks into
the `drain` which keeps the immediate surrounding surface cleaner than if spills were just poured onto the countertop.

## Part 2: Observation

<ul>
  <li>
    Some users will not use this machine if there is a line
    <ul>
      <li>I observed that some users would rather just go get a different drink - such as water or milk - then use this machine if there is a line.</li>
      <li> Some users do not seem to care if there is a line.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Users will not reset this machine to the home screen after filling up their cup</li>
  <li>Users may use the drain to empty their cups into</li>
  <li>Users do not use the filters</li>
	<li>
    Users tend to spam inputs if the screen is operating slowly
    <ul>
      <li>Continuously tapping the water button until it is "selected"</li>
      <li>Some users will be more patient, others more impatient</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  
### Interview Responses
  
<ol>
  <li>
    Do you like this interface?
    <br></br>
    The first student I talked to expressed mostly distaste for the interface: "It is annoying to navigate and can be really laggy," he said. 
    The second student expressed her distaste with the availability of the drinks - denoted by greyed out circles on the screen: 
    "Most of the drinks are usually not full," she said. The third student expressed that he did not really have any opinion on it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Would you change, add, or remove anything from this interface? You can say no if you cannot think of anything. 
    <br></br>
    The first student noted that he would prefer a different organizational structure as the circles did not make much sense to him and the 
    next two did not have any significant comments.
  </li>
  <li>
    What do you, if anything, if there is a line at the machine?
    <br></br>
    Two of the students shared that they would revert to another alternative, such as the water or milk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do you always get the same drink?
    <br></br>
    Every student shared that they usually select between 1-2 sodas or water.
  </li>
</ol>

## Part 3: Personas

### Similarities of next two personas
In this section, I am introducing two character archetypes that typify the type of users interacting with this interface. Since they both are
dealing with the same interface, they both deal with the same problems:
<ul>
  <li>Long lines to the machine</li>
  <li>Slow processor makes working with the machine difficult</li>
  <li>Lack of supply causes many of the drinks to be unavailable which is unclear from far away due to the inconspicuous marker for "unavailable"</li>
</ul>
 
### Patient Peter
Patient Peter is a complacent user, someone who waits in a line for an inefficient machine when others would not. This persona represents some of
the users I interviewed who expressed a "this is fine" attitude towards this interface. The machine works, sometimes; but it works well enough to
make users like patient peter accept the reality of the situation.

### Impatient Iman
Impatient Iman is a non-complacent user, someone who will simply find alternative options then waster her time waiting in line for a machine that,
albeit does contain more options, is slow and annoying to use. This persona represents some of the users I interviewed who expressed that when
there is a line they will simply go get milk or water.

This storyboard follows `Patient Peter` across his journey to get a drink from the machine!
